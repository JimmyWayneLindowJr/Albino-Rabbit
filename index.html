        <h4>History of the Albino Rabbit's.</h4>
        <p>The breed originator was ARBA Judge Orville Miliken. He crossed an albino Dutch, an albino Polish and a small but "typical" New Zealand white and <br>through progressive selection and line breeding produced a strain of compact animals.</p>

            <h4>Where do albino rabbits come from?</h4>
            <p>Albino rabbits have a lack of melanin in their fur and eyes. Originally, albinism in rabbits was a result of genetic mutation. This mutation caused a dominant gene to <br>block the creation of an enzyme called tyrosinase. Tyrosinase is what creates pigmentation.

        <h4>Are all the white bunnies with red eyes albino?</h4>
        <p>There are many breeds, especially long standing breeds, that are capable of being breed with albino coloring, but only a few that will always have the white fur and <br>red eyes. The three recognized rabbit breeds that are albino and always have red eyes are the Himalayan, Florida White, and Californian. Why do rabbits have red eyes?<br>Red eyed rabbits occur as a result of albinism. With a couple rare exceptions, the rabbit's bodies are entirely devoid of color. The appearance of the red eye comes from a <br>reflection of the inside of the  rabbit's eye, not the color of their iris.<br>

            <h4>What are some facts about albino rabbits?</h4>
            <p>A completely albino rabbit is pure white, with no pigment in their fur or skin. Depending on which genetic type of albinism they have, albino bunnies can have red eyes,<br> or  blue eyes. Neither type is a breed in its own right though. Rather, they are both categories of color.</p>

            <h4>Breeding rabbits</h4>
            <p>The length of pregnancy in the rabbit is 31 days and the doe can produce from 1 to 12 young each time she gives birth. She can become pregnant again within a few <br>days of giving birth.<br>

            <h4>What illness do white rabbits get?</h4>
            <p> Tularemia, also known as “rabbit fever,” is a disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially rodents, <br> rabbits, and hares. Tularemia is usually a rural disease and has been reported in all U.S. states except Hawaii.
            Many people think that albinism can be dangerous but that <br>is not true. The albinism is caused because of the albino gene and it is not considered harmful. None of the researches has got any ethical concerns about albino rabbits.<br> So, albinism does not put the health of a rabbit in danger.
            What are some common diseases of pet rabbits? Common conditions of pet rabbits include upper respiratory <br>tract infections (snuffles), internal and external parasites, dental disease, gastrointestinal (GI) stasis, uterine problems (infections or cancer), and pododermatitis <br> (foot sores or sore hocks).There are two diseases of major concern in rabbits; these are Myxomatosis and Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD). These serious and <br>widespread diseases put all rabbits at risk of becoming seriously ill, and there is a chance that they may not recover.
